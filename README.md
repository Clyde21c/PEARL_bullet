PEARL: Efficient Off-policy Meta-learning via Probabilistic Context Variables   
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08254)   
Original Repository: https://github.com/katerakelly/oyster   
---
This repository is a temporary repository for example codes for a Meta-learning book scheduled to be published soon.  
The code runs on PyBullet instead of the MuJoCo simulator.   
The dependency on the rlkit library used by the original repository has been removed in here.

***As it is a temporary code, the inner structure is fairly rough and will change frequently.***
